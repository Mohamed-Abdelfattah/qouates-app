# Great Quotes

My implementation of a code-along tutorial that was part of [React - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) course on Udemy, the app was built with React.js including connection to a firbase database.

The app enables anyone to see quotes or add a new ones. Quotes can be veiewed:
- in list form which can be sorted in ascending (oldest to newst) or descending (newest to oldest).
- in detailed/fullscreen view which enables interacting to it by adding comments.

## Notes

The project was meant to be a demonstration/practice/application for the usage of the React.js and reactRouter, thus the current data are dummy ones.
