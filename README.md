# Great Qouates

My Impelementation of a code-along tutorial that was part of [React - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) course on Udemy, the app was built with React.js including api node to a firbase database.

The app enables anyone to see quoates or add a new ones.

The project was meant to be a demonestration/practice/application for the usage of the React.js and reactRouter, thus the current data are dummy ones.
